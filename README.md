# Dependency Injection with Spring
In this small project I want to create an example of how to use the Spring Framework for Dependency Injection.
This is a reference for myself but if someone finds this helpful that would be great.


### Basic Idea of the example
We have a PC which has dependencies on keyboard, mouse, monitor, power supply and internet.

For testing purposes we might like to inject part of the periphery (maybe mocks).

Also I'd like to compare using the annotations vs. the XML configuration.
